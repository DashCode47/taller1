          Hello, my name is David Lozada and I am a web developer. I thoroughly
          enjoy creating new things and never shy away from a challenge. Seeing
          ideas and concepts come to life is one of my favorite parts of the
          development process. I look forward to continue growing and developing
          the skills I already have, as well as learning new ones!
